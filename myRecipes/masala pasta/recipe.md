PREPARATIONS:-
In a large pot, bring 6 cups of water to a boil.
When the water begins to boil rapidly, add half teaspoon salt and pasta. 
Cook till al dente on a medium to high flame.
I suggest referring the instructions on the pack of pasta.
While the pasta cooks, rinse and chop the veggies.
Drain off the pasta to a colander when done and rinse in cold water.
Set aside. Reserve 3 to 4 tablespoons of pasta cooked water.

HOW TO MAKE MASALA PASTA:-
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a pan. When the oil turns hot, add cumin.
When they begin to splutter, then add finely chopped garlic. 
Fry till it begins to smell good for a minute or two.
Add onions and fry until they turn pink.
Then add chopped veggies and fry for about 2 minutes.
Next mash the tomatoes well and add it to the pan along with salt.
Cook until the tomatoes turn soft and blend well with veggies. The raw smell of tomatoes should disappear.
Add kasuri methi, red chili powder and masala powder.
Stir well and fry for a minute. Switch off the stove. If using cream add now and stir.
Add cooked pasta and 1 tablespoon oil. Toss well. Adjust salt as needed.
Add coriander leaves. If the pasta looks dry, then pour 1 to 2 tablespoons pasta cooked water.
Serve masala pasta hot.
